# _S_patial _O_mics and Bioinfor_MA_tics Lab (SOMA)

At SOMa Lab, we’re pushing the boundaries of science by developing the next-generation of scalable, cost-optimized, and highly-sensitive spatial multi-omics tools to study human health and disease. Our research aims to understand how cells of different types and states organize and interact within tissues to maintain homeostasis, and how these interactions are disrupted in disease. To address these questions, we leverage advanced techniques from single-cell multiomics, spatial barcoding, high-resolution imaging, and next-generation sequencing, alongside computational approaches rooted in statistical modeling, network analysis, and machine learning for integrative multimodal data analysis. These tools enable us to investigate some of the most pressing issues, including cancer metastasis and therapy resistance, lung remodeling in response to air pollutants, and adipose tissue dysfunction in diabetes.
